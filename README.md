# Age & Gender Classifier using Deep CNNs

## Overview
This repository implements an age and gender classification model using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project is based on the UTKFace dataset, which is a large-scale face dataset annotated with age, gender, and ethnicity. The model takes an input image of a face and predicts the age and gender of the individual.

---

## Dataset
**UTKFace Dataset**
- The UTKFace dataset consists of over 20,000 aligned and cropped face images.
- Images include annotations for:
  - **Age**: Ranging from 0 to 116 years.
  - **Gender**: Male or Female.
  - **Ethnicity**: Multiple ethnic groups.
- The dataset exhibits high variability in:
  - Pose
  - Facial expression
  - Illumination
  - Occlusion
  - Resolution

**Note**: Input images for testing must be preprocessed to ensure vertical alignment and cropping.

---

## Features
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Uses state-of-the-art CNNs for feature extraction and classification.
- **Multitask Learning**: Simultaneously predicts age and gender.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances model robustness by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generates confusion matrices and loss/accuracy curves for insights.

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```

### Model Training
Train the age and gender classifier:
```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/train_config.json
```

### Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on the test set:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model_path models/saved_model.pth
```

### Prediction
Make predictions on new images:
```bash
python src/predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```

## Results
- **Age Prediction Accuracy**: `X%`
- **Gender Prediction Accuracy**: `Y%`
- Sample visualizations:
  - Confusion matrix for gender classification.
  - Distribution of age predictions.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add ethnicity prediction as an additional task.
- Improve model robustness for edge cases (e.g., occluded faces).
- Real-time inference using optimized deployment tools.
